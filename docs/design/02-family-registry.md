# Family Registry

Each family should be represented by a small structured object.

## Required Fields

- `name`
- `n_response`
- `dpars`
- `links`
- `inverse_links`
- `bounds`
- `density_id`
- `simulate`
- `starting_values`
- `check_data`

## Implemented: Gaussian Location-Scale

The first implementation accepts `stats::gaussian()` and maps it internally to:

```r
drm_family(
  name = "gaussian",
  n_response = 1,
  dpars = c("mu", "sigma"),
  links = c(mu = "identity", sigma = "log")
)
```

This is implemented for fixed-effect models, including optional diagonal known
sampling variance through `meta_known_V(V = vi)`. Random effects, sparse known
covariance, and additional families are later phases.

## Implemented: Bivariate Gaussian Location-Coscale

```r
biv_gaussian <- function() {
  drm_family(
    name = "biv_gaussian",
    n_response = 2,
    dpars = c("mu1", "mu2", "sigma1", "sigma2", "rho12"),
    links = c(
      mu1 = "identity",
      mu2 = "identity",
      sigma1 = "log",
      sigma2 = "log",
      rho12 = "atanh"
    )
  )
}
```

This family is implemented for fixed-effect models with separate location,
scale, and residual-correlation formulas:

```r
bf(
  mu1 = y1 ~ x1 + x2,
  mu2 = y2 ~ x1,
  sigma1 = ~ z1,
  sigma2 = ~ z2,
  rho12 = ~ w
)
```

`rho12` uses an atanh link internally and `tanh()` on the response scale.
Random effects and `mvbind()` shorthand are planned but not implemented.

## Design Principle

Do not expose a large distribution zoo before the fitting, prediction,
simulation, and diagnostic machinery is stable.
