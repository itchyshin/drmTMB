# drmTMB Agent Instructions

`drmTMB` is an R package for fast univariate and bivariate distributional
regression using Template Model Builder.

## Core Scope

- Support one-response and two-response models only.
- Use one formula per distributional parameter.
- Prioritize location, scale, shape, zero inflation, random-effect scale, and
  residual correlation.
- Higher-dimensional multivariate models belong to `gllvmTMB`, not `drmTMB`.
- Meta-analysis is Gaussian regression with known sampling covariance; do not
  introduce `meta_gaussian()` or `tau ~` syntax without an explicit design
  decision.
- `rho12` is the canonical residual bivariate correlation parameter. `rho` may
  become an alias later, but docs and tests should use `rho12`.
- Bivariate models should prefer separate response formulas (`mu1 = y1 ~ ...`,
  `mu2 = y2 ~ ...`). `mvbind()` is only shorthand for identical location
  formulas.

## Design Rules

1. Do not add a new family without simulation tests.
2. Do not add user-facing functions without roxygen2 documentation.
3. Do not change formula grammar without updating
   `docs/design/01-formula-grammar.md`.
4. Do not change likelihood parameterization without updating
   `docs/design/03-likelihoods.md`.
5. Do not add random effects before fixed-effect likelihoods are tested.
6. Keep pull requests small and focused.
7. Every meaningful change should update `docs/dev-log/check-log.md`.
8. Every completed task or phase should create an after-task or after-phase
   report following `docs/design/10-after-task-protocol.md`.
9. If code is ported from `gllvmTMB` or another package, document provenance in
   `inst/COPYRIGHTS` before treating the change as complete.

## Standard Commands

```r
devtools::document()
devtools::test()
devtools::check()
pkgdown::check_pkgdown()
```

## Recovery Checkpoints

For long Codex runs, stream failures, or handoffs, create a compact recovery
checkpoint before continuing:

```sh
Rscript tools/codex-checkpoint.R --goal "current task" --next "next command or edit"
```

The script writes a Markdown snapshot under
`docs/dev-log/recovery-checkpoints/` with git status, changed files, diff stat,
the newest check-log evidence, newest after-task reports, and exact commands for
the next agent to rerun. A checkpoint is only a handoff aid: repository state is
authoritative, so always rerun `git status` and `git diff` before editing.

## Definition of Done

A feature is done only when implementation, tests, documentation, examples,
check logs, after-task notes, and review are all present.

## Writing Style

For user-facing prose, developer notes, after-task reports, and release text,
write for a named reader and keep the prose concrete. The main readers are
applied ecology, evolution, and environmental-science users, plus statistical
method developers and R package contributors.

- Name the purpose before mechanics.
- Pair symbolic equations, R syntax, and interpretation when explaining models.
- Use concrete terms, files, equations, functions, or numerical results rather
  than vague phrases such as "various factors" or "significant improvements".
- Use active voice when the agent matters.
- Do not turn prose into bullets unless the content is a genuine list.
- Keep terms stable: `sigma`, `rho12`, `sd(group)`, `meta_known_V(V = V)`,
  `phylo()`, `spatial()`, `mu`, and `nu` should not drift across documents.
  Mention `tau` only when explaining a second shape parameter or when
  contrasting drmTMB's `sigma` with meta-analysis notation.
- Support factual, statistical, or literature claims with a citation, local
  evidence, or a clear note that the statement is a design assumption.
- Define location, scale, shape, and coscale at first use; connect coscale to
  residual correlation `rho12`.
- For tutorials and error-message docs, tell the reader what to try next when a
  model or syntax is unsupported.

Use the project-local `prose-style-review` skill for substantial README,
vignette, pkgdown, after-task, release, or paper-oriented text. This skill was
adapted from lessons in `yzhao062/agent-style`; do not copy that project into
this repository or add it as a package dependency without a separate decision.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

Codex and Claude Code may both contribute to this repository. All agent work
must follow the same project rules:

- preserve the univariate/bivariate scope;
- avoid unreviewed likelihood or formula-grammar changes;
- update design docs when architecture changes;
- add tests with implementation;
- do not revert changes made by another agent or human unless explicitly asked;
- prefer small, reviewable commits or pull requests.

When an agent hands work to another agent, leave enough context in
`docs/dev-log/check-log.md` or the relevant issue/PR for the next agent to
continue without rediscovering the whole problem.

Claude Code should read this file first. It should not introduce a parallel
agent configuration system inside the package unless the project owner asks for
one.

## Standing Review Roles

These names are shorthand for recurring review perspectives. They do not run
continuously; the orchestrator should launch them only for bounded tasks. Use
these canonical names when reporting team perspectives; do not rename them in
status updates or project notes.

| Name | Role | Primary questions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ada | Orchestrator and integrator | What should happen next, and are code, math, docs, tests, pkgdown, and git consistent? |
| Boole | R API and formula reviewer | Is the syntax memorable, parseable, and internally consistent? |
| Gauss | TMB likelihood and numerical reviewer | Is the likelihood correct and numerically stable? |
| Noether | Mathematical consistency reviewer | Do the symbolic equations, R syntax, and TMB implementation match exactly? |
| Darwin | Ecology/evolution audience reviewer | Does the example answer a real biological question for the target audience? |
| Florence | Scientific figure editor and visualization reviewer | Are plots publication-quality, interpretable, accessible, and honest about uncertainty? |
| Fisher | Statistical inference reviewer | Do simulations, comparator checks, likelihood profiles, and identifiability diagnostics support the claim? |
| Pat | Applied PhD student user tester | Can a new applied user follow the tutorial, interpret output, recover from errors, and avoid hidden jargon? |
| Jason | Landscape and source-map scout | What do related packages and papers already do, and what should `drmTMB` learn or avoid? |
| Curie | Simulation and testing specialist | Do recovery tests cover ordinary, edge, and malformed-input cases without becoming too slow? |
| Emmy | R package architecture reviewer | Are S3 methods, object structures, extractors, and internal APIs coherent? |
| Grace | CI, pkgdown, CRAN, and reproducibility engineer | Will this pass on all platforms, deploy cleanly, and avoid compiled-code or dependency risk? |
| Rose | Systems auditor | What discrepancies, repeated mistakes, stale wording, unsupported claims, and missing feedback loops are accumulating? |

Figure quality is shared work. Florence leads the final scientific-figure
standard, but Pat, Fisher, Rose, Darwin, Grace, Boole, and Noether should help
before a figure reaches her: they should notice missing uncertainty, wrong data
grain, unsupported-looking syntax, weak reader guidance, stale claims, failed
render evidence, and figures that are technically present but visually
unhelpful. Use the project-local `figure-visual-audit` skill when plots,
figure galleries, simulation graphics, or rendered pkgdown pages are under
review. A good figure should help users understand the model and help the team
catch wrong assumptions.

## Team Improvement Loop

When a task exposes a better way for the team to work, record it in
`docs/dev-log/team-improvements.md`. Low-risk documentation, process, and local
skill improvements can be implemented immediately. Product, architecture, or
validation-policy changes need a normal task, evidence, and review.

## pkgdown Policy

The pkgdown site is a first-class project artifact. User-facing features should
include reference documentation and, when substantial, an article or tutorial.
Keep `_pkgdown.yml` synchronized with exported functions and vignettes.

## Hermes Policy

Hermes is optional external lab orchestration. It is not a package dependency
and should not be installed inside this repository or required for development.
